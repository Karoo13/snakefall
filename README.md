# Snakefall

A [Snakebird](https://store.steampowered.com/app/357300/Snakebird/) clone with a level editor, forked from [thejoshwolfe/snakefall](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/snakefall/).

If you haven't played Snakebird yet, go buy it and play it. It's great!
This project is not trying to compete with the original game,
but instead tries to realise even more potential inherent in the genius
of the original game engine design.

This project enables players to create their own levels and share them with others.

# Snakefall

A [Snakebird](http://snakebird.noumenongames.com/) clone.

## Demo

[http://wolfesoftware.com/snakefall/](http://wolfesoftware.com/snakefall/)

## Status

All the game engine mechanics of the original Snakebird are programmed except for the shtick in levels 30-38.

### TODO

Important:

 * Level editor with local save and load (no server)
 * Enable Snakebird levels 30-38
 * Ability to queue up several levels and play them all in sequence.
   * Then provide a set with all the standard levels.

Fun stuff:

 * Lasers and mirrors (of course)
 * Buttons and doors (why not)
 * Actual graphics?
   * Background decorations?
   * Different kinds of fruit?
 * Animated movement?
 * [Curious George](http://steamcommunity.com/stats/357300/achievements) achivement (just kidding)
